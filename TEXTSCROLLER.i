	DC.B	"!! WARNING !! - EPILEPSY DANGER AHEAD !!   SERIOUSLY... NO JOKE :)       WELCOME TO ### MECHMICROBES ### KONEY FOURTH AMIGA INTRO RELEASE!! DISLAIMER: THIS INTRO USES SELF MODIFYING CODE... YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED... :)   SO I FINALLY MANAGED TO PUT TOGHETER MY NIBBLE OF AMIGA INTROS AND I'M SO EXCITED TO RELEASE THIS THAT I THINK THIS TEXT WILL BE REALLY SHORT! AS USUAL LET'S START SPEAKING ABOUT THE TUNE, IT WAS COMPOSED IN LONDON BACK IN 1998 USING OCTAMED SOUNDSTUDIO AND PUBLISHED ON VYNIL IN 1999 FOR THE FIRST RELEASE ON MY OWN LABEL KONEY-RECORDS. IT'S ANOTHER INDUSTRIAL HARDCORE TRACK BANGING YOUR BRAIN AT 205 BPM AND ACTUALLY ONE OF MY FAV TRACKS EVER. SPEAKING OF AMIGACORE AND VYNIL, A NEW AMIGA TRACK WHICH I MADE PAST YEAR DURING LOCKDOWN IS COMING OUT ON EPITETH RECORDS THIS SUMMER. AS USUAL NOT A SOUND FOR THE WEAK :) A WORD ON GRAPHICS: WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS THE MIGHT ROLAND TR-909 DRUMMACHINE INTERFACE RECREATED IN LOW-RES. I USED TO OWN A UNIT OF THIS FANTASTIC MACHINE WHEN I MADE THIS TRACK AND I'M IN GREAT LOVE WITH HER EVER SINCE. ANYWAY I DIDN'T DRAW IT WITH AN INTRO IN MIND, I SIMPLY WANTED TO EXPERIMENT HOW A TR-909 VST PLUGIN FOR AMIGA COULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE AND LATER DECIDED TO ANIMATE THE SEQUENCER AND USE IT FOR THIS INTRO. CODING ALL TOGHETER WAS REALLY FUN AND CHALLENGING WITH VECTOR ANIMATION BEING QUITE A PITA BUT LUCKILY FOR ME THERE WERE SOME READY-TO-STEAL ROUTINES IN RAM-JAM ASSEMBLER COURSE WHICH IS BECOMING A BIBLE FOR ME! BUT THE MOST DIFFICULT TASK HAS BEEN EXTENDING THE .P61 PLAYER TO ALLOW TRACKING SAMPLES# BEING PLAYED... ITS CODE IS TRULY WEIRD AND IT TOOK ME AGES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO... HOPE I DIDN'T BREAK ANYTHING :) -  SO AS PROMISED NO MORE TYPING, JUST SOME QUICK GREETINGS TO EVERYONE WHO HELPS ME ON EAB WITH MY 68K QUESTIONS AND TO ALL THE GUYS ON POUNET WHO SUPPORT MY PRODZ, THANKS!  LAST THING: REMEMBER TO SURF WWW.KONEY.ORG FOR MORE AMIGA AND HARDCORE STUFF AND MY GITHUB FOR THE SOURCE CODE OF MY PRODZ!                     .EOF              "
